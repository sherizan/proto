# Prototo App — Custom Dev Client Spec (refined)

> Date: 2026-05-25. Status: design draft.
> Supersedes `2026-05-22-proto-app-dev-client-design.md`.
> Related: `2026-05-22-onboarding-redesign-design.md` (two-QR Step-1/Step-2 model is replaced by the single-QR model in this spec); `2026-05-24-share-landing-and-token-router-design.md` (universal-link entitlement declared here, viewer-mode handler lives there); `2026-05-24-phase-3-decomposition.md` (sub-unit F — App Store submission — gates designer rollout).

## Goal

A custom Expo dev client — published as **Prototo** — that designers install once from the App Store and that becomes the canvas for `proto start`. It renders real Apple Liquid Glass on iOS 26 devices and serves as both creator-mode dev client (Phase 2/3) and viewer-mode share runtime (Phase 3 share-landing spec).

A designer scans one QR from `proto start`, Prototo opens, the prototype loads with real Liquid Glass. No Expo Go anywhere in the flow.

## Why this refinement supersedes the 2026-05-22 spec

Three things changed between 2026-05-22 and 2026-05-25:

1. **Brand rename.** Product is now "Prototo" (commit `f750aec`), domain `prototo.app`. Old spec's `Proto` / `com.sherizan.proto` / `proto://` strings are stale.
2. **Onboarding collapsed to one QR.** The 2026-05-22 onboarding spec's two-QR model (Step 1 install Proto Preview, Step 2 scan project) was simplified to a single QR emitted by Metro. The dev-client spec needs to match.
3. **Install distribution decision.** Old spec routed designers through EAS internal sideload. New decision: designers install Prototo only from the App Store; the EAS internal path becomes a maintainer-only pre-launch testing tool.

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Folder `apps/prototo-app/` (was `apps/proto-app/`) | Match product brand |
| Bundle ID `com.sherizan.prototo` (was `com.sherizan.proto`) | Match brand. Fresh App Store Connect claim. |
| URL scheme `prototo://` (was `proto://`) | Match brand |
| Display name "Prototo" (was "Proto") | Match brand |
| EAS slug `prototo-app` | Match folder |
| `MinimumOSVersion: 26.0` | Guaranteed Liquid Glass support; intentional positioning bet |
| `associatedDomains: ["applinks:prototo.app"]` declared here | Universal-link handler is implemented in share-landing sub-unit E; entitlement must exist in the binary from launch |
| Single QR from `proto start` | Onboarding architecture (replaces two-QR Step-1/Step-2 model) |
| QR opens Prototo App via standard Expo dev-client URL (`prototo://expo-development-client/?url=...`) | Approach 1 — standard Expo path; we don't fight the framework |
| Template's `app.json` `scheme: "prototo"`, `ios.bundleIdentifier: "com.sherizan.prototo"`, `plugins: ["expo-dev-client", "expo-router"]` | All Prototo projects share Prototo App as runtime; expo-dev-client plugin + bundleIdentifier are both required for Expo CLI to even consider a custom-scheme dev-client URL (managed-project routing). |
| Template devDeps include `expo-dev-client: ~55.0.35` | Required so the Expo CLI in a scaffolded project knows it's targeting a dev client (not Expo Go). |
| `proto start` runs `expo start --dev-client --scheme prototo --ios` | The `--scheme` flag is load-bearing: for managed projects Expo CLI's `getManagedDevClientSchemeAsync` ignores `app.json` `scheme` and always emits `exp+<slug>://`. The explicit `--scheme` short-circuits that and forces `prototo://`. |
| Designer install path: **App Store only** | No TestFlight, no EAS sideload, no public install URL. Maintainer pre-launch testing uses EAS `development` profile + UDID-registered sideload, but that path is not designer-facing. |
| Simulator: Prototo App simulator binary, auto-installed by proto-cli first run | Replaces `ensureExpoGoMatchesProject` with `ensurePrototoAppMatchesProject`; tarball + manifest fetched from a stable URL keyed by Expo SDK major. Helper also boots an iOS 26 Simulator from cold if none is booted (otherwise Expo CLI would later boot one after the helper has already exited, leaving the stale binary in place). |
| Native modules baked into Prototo App | `@expo/ui`, `expo-blur`, `expo-clipboard`, `expo-dev-client`, `expo-glass-effect`, `expo-haptics`, `expo-router`, `expo-status-bar`, `expo-symbols`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-safe-area-context`, `react-native-screens`, `react-native-worklets`. Must be a superset of everything the template imports (template Home.tsx uses `expo-clipboard`; CLAUDE.md recommends `expo-symbols` SymbolView for SF Symbols). |
| Distribution: EAS Build (hosted), profiles `development`, `development-simulator`, `production` | Hosted toolchain; no Xcode 26 download required on dev machine |
| Beta versioning during validation: `@sherizan/proto-cli@0.2.0-beta.2`, `create-proto@0.2.0-beta.5`, published under npm `next` tag | Lets us validate `npm create proto@next myapp` against the actual published flow without disturbing the stable `latest` tag (`0.1.10`). Stable `0.2.0` bump happens after merge. |

**Implication for ship order:** the dev client cannot reach designers until Prototo App is on the App Store. Per the Phase 3 decomp doc, F (App Store) is the long-pole and starts in parallel. This spec describes the build and the wiring; first designer-visible release lands when F completes.

## Out of scope (explicit, deferred)

- TestFlight beta channel — App Store-only per the install decision
- OTA updates via `expo-updates` — every native change requires App Store update
- Android — Material You / Jetpack Compose story is its own future spec
- Auth, accounts, telemetry inside Prototo App
- Custom native modules beyond Expo SDK 55 bundled set
- Viewer-mode runtime (sub-unit E in Phase 3 decomp) — Prototo App declares the universal-link entitlement here, but the actual viewer code lands in sub-unit E
- Comment pins, version history (Phase 4)

## Architecture

### Why standard Expo dev-client (not custom proxy / not universal-link)

Three approaches were considered:

1. **Standard Expo dev-client** *(chosen)*. Project + Prototo App both declare `scheme: "prototo"`. `expo start --dev-client` generates `prototo://expo-development-client/?url=...` natively. Minimal custom code; we don't fight Expo's URL conventions.
2. **Custom QR proxy** — proto-cli scrapes Metro stdout and synthesises its own QR. Rejected: brittle if Expo CLI output format changes; only buys per-project scheme namespacing, which designers don't need (they don't deep-link between prototypes).
3. **Universal links via prototo.app** (`https://prototo.app/dev?host=<lan>`) — Rejected for the dev-client path: couples local dev to prototo.app availability and adds round-tripping for what is a LAN handoff. Universal links *are* the right tool for the share-landing flow (stakeholder receiving a hosted snapshot link), but that's a separate flow handled by the share-landing spec.

### Why the simulator-binary-via-CDN piece

Simulator can't use App Store (no App Store on Simulator). Three options considered:

1. Vendor the `.app` inside `proto-cli` — bloats the npm package by ~50MB. Rejected.
2. **Fetch on first run from a stable URL** *(chosen)*. Small artifact, version-pinned by Expo SDK major. proto-cli verifies hash, caches in `~/.prototo/cache/`. Survives offline use after first run.
3. Require maintainer to run a build script per dev machine — Rejected: breaks "one command" promise.

Option 2 means each `pnpm release:simulator` ships a new artifact when the Expo SDK is bumped; designers pick it up transparently on their next `proto start`. SDK-bump pain on Simulator becomes a 1–2 minute auto-download, not a maintainer-instruction-laden re-install.

## File changes

### Renamed (mechanical, every reference)

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `apps/proto-app/` | `apps/prototo-app/` |
| `apps/proto-app/package.json` `"name": "proto-app"` | `"name": "prototo-app"` |
| `apps/proto-app/app.json` `"name": "Proto"` | `"name": "Prototo"` |
| `apps/proto-app/app.json` `"slug": "proto-app"` | `"slug": "prototo-app"` |
| `apps/proto-app/app.json` `"scheme": "proto"` | `"scheme": "prototo"` |
| `apps/proto-app/app.json` `"bundleIdentifier": "com.sherizan.proto"` | `"bundleIdentifier": "com.sherizan.prototo"` |
| `apps/proto-app/app.json` `extra.eas.projectId: "0fc08f0e-..."` | remove (EAS provisions a fresh ID on first build under new slug) |

### New / added inside `apps/prototo-app/`

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `apps/prototo-app/app.json` ios.infoPlist additions | `"MinimumOSVersion": "26.0"`; existing `"ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption": false` kept |
| `apps/prototo-app/app.json` ios.associatedDomains | `["applinks:prototo.app"]` |
| `apps/prototo-app/eas.json` | Add `production` profile: `{ "distribution": "store", "autoIncrement": true }` |
| `apps/prototo-app/scripts/release-simulator.ts` | Maintainer-only. Downloads `.tar.gz` of the most recent `development-simulator` EAS build, computes SHA256, uploads `Prototo.app.tar.gz` + `manifest.json` (`{ sdkMajor: number, sha256: string, builtAt: ISO8601 }`) to a stable URL. Initial host: GitHub Releases on this repo, tag format `prototo-sim-sdk<sdkMajor>-<incrementingBuild>` (e.g. `prototo-sim-sdk55-3`). proto-cli reads `manifest.json` from `https://github.com/<owner>/proto/releases/download/prototo-sim-sdk<major>-latest/manifest.json` (latest pointer maintained by the release script). Wired into `package.json` `scripts` as `release:simulator`. |
| `apps/prototo-app/README.md` (existing) | Update copy: drop any "Proto" references, describe maintainer build commands and release flow. |

### Modified in `packages/proto-cli/src/`

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `expo-spawn.ts` | `spawnExpo` invokes `npx expo start --dev-client --ios` instead of `npx expo start --ios`. Test updated accordingly. |
| `ensure-expo-go.ts` → renamed `ensure-prototo-app.ts` | `EXPO_GO_BUNDLE_ID = 'host.exp.Exponent'` → `PROTOTO_APP_BUNDLE_ID = 'com.sherizan.prototo'`. On simulator-major mismatch (or app missing): fetch `Prototo.app.tar.gz` from the configured stable URL, verify against `manifest.json` SDK major + hash, unpack into `~/.prototo/cache/<sdkMajor>-<shortHash>/`, install via `xcrun simctl install booted <path>`. On offline + cached version mismatched: log a designer-friendly message via the translation layer ("Your Simulator's Prototo is older than this project. Connect to the internet to update, or run `proto start` once with connection."). |
| `ensure-expo-go.test.ts` → renamed `ensure-prototo-app.test.ts` | Rewritten: bundle-ID detection, manifest fetch + hash verification (mocked HTTP), cache hit/miss paths, install invocation, offline fallback message. |
| `messages.ts` | Remove any Expo Go-flavoured copy. Add: `installingPrototoApp` ("Setting up Prototo on the Simulator…"), `prototoAppOutdated` (when phone Prototo App is older than the project's Expo SDK — copy: "This project needs a newer Prototo. Update from the App Store and try again."), `prototoSimulatorOffline` (offline + cached mismatch message above). |
| `messages.test.ts` | Cover new keys. |
| `start.ts` | Replace `ensureExpoGoMatchesProject` call site with `ensurePrototoAppMatchesProject`. Import + parameter updates only. |
| `error-translation.ts` | If applicable, map any Metro/Expo error strings about Expo Go to Prototo equivalents. |

### Modified in `packages/create-proto/template/`

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `.proto/expo-config/app.json` | `"scheme": "{{name}}"` → `"scheme": "prototo"`. All Prototo projects share this scheme so Prototo opens them via the dev-client URL convention. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Audit for any stray "Expo Go" / "Proto App" mentions; rewrite to "Prototo". |
| `README.md` | Add a single line at the top: "Before running `proto start`, install Prototo from the App Store." (Until App Store ship, this README copy is a maintainer-time follow-up — not blocking spec merge.) |

### Modified in `docs/`

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `docs/proto-master.md` | Replace all remaining "Proto App" → "Prototo App". Update §11/§14 file-structure block: `proto-app/` → `prototo-app/`. Remove stale "Expo Go" preview-surface mentions (e.g., §3's "Phase 1+2 fallback via Expo Go" line and §14's install-Expo-Go copy block) — preview surface is now Prototo on simulator (auto-installed) and Prototo on iPhone (App Store). Add a decisions-log entry: "2026-05-25: dev-client rename Proto → Prototo. Single-QR onboarding (supersedes two-QR Step-1/Step-2). App Store-only designer install path. SDK-bump pain on iPhone surfaces as a 'Update Prototo' screen." |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-proto-app-dev-client-design.md` | Add a banner at the top: `> Status: superseded by 2026-05-25-prototo-app-dev-client-design.md`. Keep the file as historical record. |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-onboarding-redesign-design.md` | Add a note: the two-QR Step-1/Step-2 architecture in §1 and §2 is superseded by the single-QR model in `2026-05-25-prototo-app-dev-client-design.md`. Keep the rest (copy patterns, terminal output style) — still canonical. |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-24-share-landing-and-token-router-design.md` | Sync references: `Proto App` → `Prototo App`, `com.sherizan.proto` → `com.sherizan.prototo`, `apps/proto-app/` → `apps/prototo-app/`, `applinks:` `appID` field uses new bundle ID. |

## Build / install / release flow

### Per Expo SDK bump (maintainer)

```
cd apps/prototo-app

# Simulator binary — designer-facing, must always be live
eas build --platform ios --profile development-simulator
pnpm release:simulator
  → downloads .app from EAS
  → tars + hashes
  → uploads Prototo.app.tar.gz + manifest.json
    to GitHub Release tagged prototo-app@<sdkMajor>.<n>

# Device binary — App Store path
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas submit --platform ios --latest
  → uploads to App Store Connect
  → maintainer files for review

# Maintainer pre-launch device testing only (not designer-facing)
eas build --platform ios --profile development
  → returns internal install URL
  → maintainer adds own UDID, sideloads via Safari
```

### Designer-facing flow (post-App-Store ship)

```
One-time setup (designer, on iPhone):
  Open App Store → search "Prototo" → Install

Per-project:
  $ npm create proto@latest myapp
  → scaffolds project, auto-runs proto start
  → "Open Prototo, scan this QR:"
  → [single QR]

  Designer scans QR with Camera → iOS routes to Prototo via prototo://
    OR opens Prototo manually and taps "Scan QR" inside the app
  → Prototo loads bundle from Mac's Metro
  → Welcome screen renders with real Liquid Glass

Simulator path (auto, no user action):
  proto start
  → ensurePrototoAppMatchesProject downloads + installs simulator binary
    if missing or SDK mismatch (silent if already present)
  → expo start --dev-client --ios boots Simulator + opens Prototo
  → Welcome screen renders
```

## Version-mismatch handling

When designer's installed Prototo's bundled Expo SDK major ≠ project's Expo SDK major:

- **Simulator** — auto-detected and refreshed by `ensurePrototoAppMatchesProject` before Metro starts. Silent on success; designer-friendly progress message on download.
- **iPhone** — cannot be auto-updated by the CLI. Prototo App itself detects the mismatch when loading the bundle and shows a designer-readable screen: *"This project needs a newer Prototo. Update from the App Store and try again."* The CLI surfaces the same hint via the translation layer if it detects a 5+ second silence after QR scan (the device never reached `/onLaunch`).

SDK-bump pain on iPhone is gated by App Store update — acceptable as a once-per-SDK cost.

## Definition of done

- [x] Folder renamed `apps/proto-app/` → `apps/prototo-app/`; all package, app.json, eas.json fields updated to Prototo branding (name, slug, bundle ID, scheme)
- [x] `apps/prototo-app/app.json` declares `MinimumOSVersion: 26.0` + `associatedDomains: ["applinks:prototo.app"]`
- [x] `eas.json` has `development`, `development-simulator`, `production`, `preview` profiles
- [x] `pnpm release:simulator` script lives in `apps/prototo-app/` and successfully publishes a tarball + manifest to a stable URL (GitHub Releases, this repo)
- [x] `proto-cli` rename: `ensure-expo-go.{ts,test.ts}` → `ensure-prototo-app.{ts,test.ts}`; downloads, caches, and installs the simulator binary on first `proto start`
- [x] `proto-cli` `spawnExpo` now invokes `npx expo start --dev-client --scheme prototo --ios` (the `--scheme` flag is load-bearing — see Locked decisions)
- [x] Template's `.proto/expo-config/app.json` declares `scheme: "prototo"`, `ios.bundleIdentifier: "com.sherizan.prototo"`, `plugins: ["expo-dev-client", "expo-router"]`; `expo-dev-client` is in template devDeps
- [x] Master doc: all "Proto App" → "Prototo App"; file-structure block updated; decisions-log entry added; 2026-05-22 demotion text removed
- [x] 2026-05-22 dev-client spec marked superseded with banner
- [x] 2026-05-22 onboarding spec annotated: two-QR model superseded by single-QR
- [x] 2026-05-24 share-landing spec synced to new bundle ID + folder name
- [x] Maintainer EAS `development` build sideloaded on Sheri's iPhone; `proto start` from a fresh `create-proto myapp` scan-with-camera opens Prototo (not Expo Go) and renders welcome screen with **visible Apple Liquid Glass refraction** in Card glass + native large-title nav bar
- [x] Simulator path: fresh `proto start` on a clean machine downloads Prototo simulator binary, installs it, opens the prototype, welcome screen renders (cold-boot verified — helper auto-boots the Simulator when none is running)
- [x] Designer-facing copy contains zero mentions of "Expo Go", "Expo", or any engineering branding (sole acceptable exceptions: `messages.test.ts` anti-pattern guard and `render-qr.test.ts` URL fixture; `apps/prototo-app/README.md` explains historically why Prototo exists)
- [x] All existing proto-cli tests pass; new tests cover `ensure-prototo-app` download + cache + version-mismatch + Simulator-auto-boot paths (103 tests, 14 files, all green)
- [ ] App Store submission filed (Phase 3 sub-unit F; tracked separately, not blocking this spec's merge)

## Implementation footnotes

The implementation deviated from the original plan in several places. These follow-up commits land the corrections in chronological order:

| Commit | Subject | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `f196933` | `expo-clipboard` native module | Template Home.tsx imports `expo-clipboard`; original Prototo App package.json omitted it. |
| `0166833` | `expo-symbols` in app + template | CLAUDE.md recommends `expo-symbols` SymbolView; needed in both Prototo App's native bundle and the template's deps. |
| `1137d55` | `--scheme prototo` flag in expo-spawn | Expo CLI's `getManagedDevClientSchemeAsync` ignores `app.json` `scheme` for managed projects; the only working override is `--scheme` on the command line. |
| `5d53a17` | `release-simulator` uses `buildProfile` not `profile` | The EAS API's `build:list --json` returns `buildProfile`, not `profile`. The original script's `find()` always returned undefined. |
| `7338ddf` / `bd9bfb8` | `expo-dev-client` plugin + `addGeneratedScheme: false` in template | Required by Expo CLI to even consider a custom-scheme dev-client URL. (`addGeneratedScheme: false` ended up not load-bearing on its own — the `--scheme` flag is — but doesn't hurt to keep set.) |
| `05f478c` | `ios.bundleIdentifier` + `expo-dev-client` devDep in template | Expo CLI errors `Required property 'ios.bundleIdentifier' is not found` when `--dev-client` is set and the project doesn't declare it. |
| `deab06b` | `ensure-prototo-app` auto-boots Simulator | Original design no-op'd silently when no Simulator was booted, leaving the stale binary in place. Helper now finds an iOS 26 device via `simctl list devices available --json`, boots it, polls for ready, then proceeds. |

Net branch shape: 24 commits on `feat/prototo-app-dev-client`, 103 proto-cli tests + 48 create-proto tests all green, betas published to npm under `next` tag.

## Open risks

## Open risks

1. **App Store rejection** is the only thing blocking designer rollout. Mitigations: keep the dev-client UI surface minimal (host screen + dev tools); ensure App Store metadata frames Prototo accurately as a developer/designer tool with viewer-mode use case (not a free-form code runner, which Apple has historically rejected). Plan B if review drags >2 weeks: ship TestFlight invites manually — not a spec-level decision now, but noted.
2. **`MinimumOSVersion: 26.0`** excludes designers not yet on iOS 26. Per master-doc positioning ("Liquid Glass without Xcode") this is the intentional bet. Acceptance criterion: master doc's iOS-26 stance stays the product line, even at the cost of early adopters on older OS.
3. **Simulator Liquid Glass fidelity unknown.** iOS 26 Simulator may not paint the real material even with the correct binary + entitlements. If it doesn't, the simulator path still works for layout/interaction iteration but the Liquid Glass promise becomes device-only. Validate during DoD acceptance.
4. **Stable URL for simulator binary.** GitHub Releases is the initial choice (zero infra cost, signed by repo). If artifact size or download speed becomes an issue, migrate to `prototo.app/assets/` later — the spec requires "a stable URL", not a specific host.
5. **`com.sherizan.prototo` bundle claim.** Needs fresh registration in App Store Connect under the user's developer account. Old `com.sherizan.proto` claim is abandoned (no public release happened, so safe to leave dormant).
6. **EAS project ID for the renamed slug.** First `eas build` under the new slug provisions a fresh project ID; the existing `0fc08f0e-...` in `app.json` is removed so EAS prompts on first build.
7. **EAS API field name (`buildProfile`, not `profile`).** The `eas build:list --json` output uses `buildProfile`; `release-simulator.ts` originally looked for `profile` and silently found nothing. Future scripts touching `eas build:list` should grep for `buildProfile` to match the API.

## What this spec does not change

- Phase 1 components, CLI commands, templates: structurally unchanged. The dev-client work is additive on top of the existing onboarding redesign.
- Designer's prompt-driven workflow inside Claude Code: unchanged.
- `proto design` command: unchanged.
- DESIGN.md / CLAUDE.md template structure: copy edits for branding only.
- The single-QR onboarding output style established in `2026-05-22-onboarding-redesign-design.md` §2: kept; just the underlying QR payload changes from `exp://` to `prototo://expo-development-client/?url=...`.
