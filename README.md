**The prompt-native design environment for native iOS.**

Designers describe what they want; native iOS UI appears in the Simulator, with Apple's real Liquid Glass on iOS 26+. No canvas. No IDE. No engineering.

## Demo

[![Watch the demo on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/9yX9f9UxfJo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9yX9f9UxfJo)

## Quick start

```bash
npm create proto@latest myapp
```

That's it. The iOS Simulator opens with a Welcome screen. In another terminal:

```bash
cd myapp && claude
```

Then describe what you want. Example:

```
> add a liquid glass bottom tab bar with Home, Explore, Library, Profile tabs
```

Claude Code generates `app/_layout.tsx` using Apple's native `UITabBar` (via `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs`). Metro hot-reloads. The Simulator updates instantly with a real refractive Liquid Glass tab bar and SF Symbol icons — no engineering needed.

> Note: the npm package is `create-proto` (and the CLI bin is `proto`) for historical reasons. The brand and product name is **Prototo** — that's what designers see in the banner, in the iOS nav bar, and at [prototo.app](https://prototo.app).

## Prerequisites

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| **Xcode** (with iOS Simulator) | The iOS Simulator IS the canvas. Required to render your prototype. Install via the Mac App Store (large download — give it time). Run it once and accept the license before using Prototo. |
| **macOS** | Xcode runs only on Mac. Windows / Linux not supported for Phase 2. |
| **Node.js 18+** | Runtime for Prototo's CLI. Install via [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or your package manager. |
| **Claude Code** | The design tool. Install with `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli` and authenticate before using. |

iOS Simulator with **iOS 26+** is recommended — that's where Apple's native Liquid Glass material renders. Older iOS versions fall back to a plain surface.

The designer never touches a file. Every change is a prompt.

## Preview on iPhone (optional)

Want to feel your prototype on a real iPhone — Liquid Glass, system haptics, real gestures?

**Open <https://prototo.app/install/ios> on your iPhone** and follow the 3-step install (~2 minutes, no App Store, no Expo account needed). Once Prototo is on your home screen, `proto start` in your project gives you a QR your Camera can scan.

## What's in the box

When `create-proto` scaffolds your project, you get:

- **`DESIGN.md`** — your design system source of truth. Tokens (color, spacing, typography, radius), component library choice, and screen registry. Update it by prompting Claude.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — instructions for Claude Code, scoped to this project. Tells Claude to prefer Apple's native components (UITabBar, SF Symbols, `@expo/ui`, GlassView) over wrappers. Includes the Prototo component library reference.
- **`components/proto/`** — fallback primitives for things native iOS doesn't ship: layout helpers (`Screen`, `Stack`, `Row`), themed text, generic `Card` with Liquid Glass support, animated `Button`, `Toggle`, `Modal`, `Divider`. Plus four subpath modules for motion + graphics: `motion` (declarative transitions), `gestures` (drag / scroll / shared-value), `lottie` (LottieFiles + After Effects playback), `canvas` (custom drawing). Read-only, managed by Prototo.
- **`screens/Home.tsx`** — Welcome screen with a Liquid Glass hero card and a 2-step tutorial (background color → native tab bar) with Copy buttons.
- **`app/`** — expo-router routing layer. Thin re-exports of `screens/`. `app/_layout.tsx` configures the native UINavigationBar with large titles.
- **`assets/lottie/`** — drop LottieFiles / After Effects JSON exports here; the Prototo `Lottie` component picks them up via `require('../assets/lottie/<name>.json')`.
- **`proto.config.js`** — the only file designers may edit directly (theme, accent, app name, layout, motion preferences).
- Pre-configured for Expo SDK 55 with `expo-glass-effect`, `react-native-reanimated 4`, `react-native-worklets`, `react-native-ease`, `lottie-react-native`, `@shopify/react-native-skia`, `@expo/ui`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `expo-clipboard`.

## Motion & graphics

Prototo ships with four curated modules in `components/proto/` for micro-interactions and graphics — wired into the runtime, never imported directly by designers. Claude picks the right one based on your prompt:

| Module | When Claude reaches for it | Powered by |
|---|---|---|
| `motion` | "fade this in" / "scale on tap" / "slide up on mount" | `react-native-ease` — declarative, native platform animator (CAAnimation / ObjectAnimator), zero JS overhead |
| `gestures` | "drag this card" / "swipe to delete" / "parallax this header" | `react-native-reanimated` + `react-native-gesture-handler` — imperative shared values + worklets |
| `lottie` | "play assets/lottie/confetti.json when subscribe is tapped" | `lottie-react-native` — LottieFiles / After Effects timeline playback |
| `canvas` | "draw a gradient blob behind the header" | `@shopify/react-native-skia` — custom drawing surfaces |

Example prompts:

```
> fade the welcome card in on mount with a 200ms ease-out
> add a draggable card that springs back when released
> drop a celebration Lottie when the user taps Subscribe
> draw a gradient confetti burst behind the header on Home
```

All four native modules are pre-bundled in the Prototo App (device + simulator) and pre-installed in the project template, so no extra setup.

## Commands

After install, inside your project:

```bash
npx proto start         # Boot Metro + open Simulator
npx proto new-screen    # Scaffold a new screen
npx proto reset         # Clear Metro + project caches
npx proto design        # Interactive: theme + accent + component library
npx proto help          # Show all commands
```

Designers typically only use `npx proto start` — everything else happens via Claude Code prompts.

## How it works

```
You ──prompt──► Claude Code
                    │
                    ▼ writes files
                screens/X.tsx + app/x.tsx
                    │
                    ▼ Metro detects change
                Hot reload
                    │
                    ▼ JS bundles
                iOS Simulator updates
                    │
                    ▼ renders
                Native iOS UI + Liquid Glass
```

Three principles drive the architecture:

1. **The iOS Simulator is the canvas.** Every change a designer makes appears in the Simulator within milliseconds via Metro hot reload. No build step, no preview render.
2. **Apple-native first.** Prototo's `CLAUDE.md` tells Claude to use Apple's native components (UITabBar via `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs`, SF Symbols via `expo-symbols`, SwiftUI primitives via `@expo/ui/swift-ui`, Liquid Glass via `expo-glass-effect`) before any wrapper. This gets you real iOS fidelity for free.
3. **Designers never touch code.** All interaction is prompts in Claude Code. The CLI takes a single command (`proto start`) and does the right thing.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Status | What |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 — Scaffolding + preview | ✅ Shipped | `create-proto` scaffolds a project, `proto start` runs Metro + Simulator |
| Phase 2 — Prompt layer | ✅ Shipped | `CLAUDE.md` + `DESIGN.md` template, `proto design` interactive command, native-first component library |
| Phase 2.5 — Simulator-as-canvas MVP | ✅ Shipped | Auto-launch Simulator, ASCII banner, Expo Go auto-clean on SDK mismatch, drop custom `Nav` for native UITabBar, native large-title nav bar, iOS-26-native Liquid Glass only |
| Phase 3 — Prototo App (physical device) | ✅ Beta | Custom Expo dev client distributed via EAS Internal (see <https://prototo.app/install/ios>). Real Liquid Glass on iPhone via QR. Beta-quality; App Store version is a separate later track. |
| Phase 3 — Marketing site (`prototo.app`) | 🚧 In progress | Landing page at [prototo.app](https://prototo.app). |
| Phase 3 — Web share (`prototo.run`) | 📋 Planned | Share a QR code to a stakeholder, they run the prototype on their phone via the web companion. |
| Phase 3 — Graduate to real app | 📋 Planned | Your Prototo project IS a real Expo SDK 55 app — same `app/`, `screens/`, `components/` structure as any production Expo app. Graduation path: add EAS Build for distribution, swap placeholder data for real APIs, add auth, ship to TestFlight + App Store. We'll write the graduation guide + a `proto graduate` command that scaffolds EAS config and a `.env.production` once Phase 2.5 stabilizes. |
